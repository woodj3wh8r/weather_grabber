# weather_grabber
pulls weather data from OpenWeatherMap API and saves it to a file named weather.txt
must replace values of api_key with OpenWeatherMap  API key and zip_code with the zip code of the desired location 
after that run it manually every day or set it on a delay(I use Python anywhere tasks to run it daily)
